NOTE: the license above only applies to sources of the MOS implementation (all files that are a part of this git repository except `jsrfar.inc` and `basic4hi.ips`). All files provided by a user (person that wants to compile the source code) have their own respective copyrights and licenses. Any output binaries that are generated via compilation will be affected by these user files and their licenses will have an effect on the binaries.

JSRFAR routine has its own license, check the `jsrfar.inc` file for details.

`basic4hi.ips` is a patch to a proprietary binary. It has no use on its own without that binary. Therefore I don't think it's possible for this file to have a license at all.
